Congratulations Dr. Rizvi! On May 5th I had the delight of hooding [Abbas Rizvi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarizv/) and meeting his wonderful family after the ceremony. It has been fantastic to watch Abbas transition from a thoughtful, innovative and creative doctoral student and user of data tools to a data scientist and developer of tools and algorithms. As a student there were [papers authored](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=AkjWKAsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Bioconductor packages developed](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/gwasurvivr.html), and cocktails consumed (not pictured). He is off on a new adventure as a data scientist at the [Columbus Collaboratory](https://columbuscollaboratory.com/) and I know I will continue to see fantastic things from him. On a side note, it has now been a number of weeks since Abbas has attended lab meeting and I and I am comfortable concluding that there is a strong correlation between the amount of pizza leftover from Friday lab and Dr. Rizvi's absence. Congrats again Abbas, we miss you already!
