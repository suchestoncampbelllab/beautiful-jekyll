What a great week in the Sucheston-Campbell lab! I have zero accomplishments to report, but thank god I have 2 PhD students, who keep achieving great things! Without further ado:
[Ezgi Karaemen] (https://karaesmen.github.io) was awarded a [Pelotonia Graduate Fellowship](https://cancer.osu.edu/research-and-education/pelotonia-funded-research/pelotonia-fellowship-program) for project "The role of pharmacogenomics in survival outcomes following blood or marrow transplant" This two year award was the result of a very competitive grant application process and the lab couldn't be more thrilled for her!

[Abbas Rizvi] (https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=AkjWKAsAAAAJ&hl=en) has a development version of [gwasurvivr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.8/bioc/html/gwasurvivr.html) available for doing genome wide survival analyses in R. Modifications to the coxph function make analyses very fast and the package is user friendly for R beginners (yes really). Abbas submitted an abstract and it was selected for a talk at [BioC 2018] (https://bioc2018.bioconductor.org/talks-community). Way to represent the lab!

On a semi-related note my week had another dollop of science joy when I opened the agenda for a meeting [InterLymph 2018] (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/InterLymph/) and as I scanned the list I see that in the same section I'm speaking, but kicking off the session, is my former PhD student Alyssa Clay-Gilmour giving a talk on Multiple Myeloma and Survival; definitely a case of mentee exceeding the mentor!
