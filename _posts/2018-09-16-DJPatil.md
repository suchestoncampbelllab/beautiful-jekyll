This Wednesday, Septerber 19th, the former U.S. Chief Data Scientist and current head of technology at Devoted Health, [DJ Patil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpatil) is coming to Ohio State as part of the [Provost Discovery Themes Lecture](https://discovery.osu.edu/provosts-discovery-themes-lecturer-program-dj-patil).   Ohio State's [TDAI](https://tdai.osu.edu/) and the [Women in Analytics organization](https://www.womeninanalytics.org/) are hosting a panel prior to the lecture and I am thrilled to be a part of it along with [Kathy Koontz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/customerjourneykoontz) and [Nancy Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancy-kramer-650273/). The panel focus is Research: The Roots of Data Science, how academic and industry collaboration builds and sustains data science initiatives.
